# MeteringResponse

Upon receiving and processing a Metering message, the receiving implementation must reply with a MeteringResponse, indicating whether the update was handled successfully.

```

  MeteringMessageID = UUID
  Result            = ("Accepted" | "Rejected")
  RejectionReason   = String (Only if Result = "Rejected")
/>
```
