# Purpose

The USEF Flex Trading protocol (UFTP) is a subset of the USEF framework.
Focused specifically on the exchange of flexibility between Aggregators (AGRs) and DSOs, it describes the corresponding market interactions between them to resolve grid constraints by applying congestion management or grid-capacity management.
UFTP can be used as a stand-alone protocol for flexibility forecasting, offering, ordering, and settlement processes.
Its purpose is to support the use of flexibility markets for grid-congestion issues and standardize the set-up and operation of these markets across different DSOs.
